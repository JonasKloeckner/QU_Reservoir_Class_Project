# QUANTIFYING UNCERTAINTY FOR RESERVOIR MODELING - CLASS PROJECT

Decision-making in reservoir production is a challenge task due to the high uncertainty. This repository contains the python code for a class project that aims to investigate reservoir modeling in a Bayesian Evidential Learning framework (see Scheidt et al., 2018). 

Multi points geostatistics using a training image to generate multiple facies realizations conditionate to the wells. Porosity and permeability uncertainty quantification per facies using Monte Carlo sequential Gaussian simulation. Flow simulation to generate multiple realizations for pressure and water saturation over 30 years.


## Installation
To run the project, the following dependencies must be met:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [SGeMS](https://sgems.sourceforge.net/)
